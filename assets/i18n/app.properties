#TUTORIAL SCRIPT
tutorial_header1=Hello Friend!
tutorial_content1= Welcome to VIKING STOP. We need your tactical skills to defend \
    our monastery from the attacking Vikings by sinking their ships. Please tap on an approaching ship to sink it!
tutorial_header2= Great Job!
tutorial_content2= Sometimes, potion bottles appear in the ocean. Wait for one to appear and try to \
  harness their power by sinking another ship.
tutorial_header3= Excellent! You're almost ready.
tutorial_content3= Vikings appear increasingly over time. If they get close to our shore they start attacking. \
  Once our health bar runs out we lose the battle.
tutorial_header4= Oh... One last thing

  Feel free to improve your skills in the PRACTICE MODE.
