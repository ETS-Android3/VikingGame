# VikingGame

## Project Description
The game is a ”who can survive the longest” online multiplayer game. The game is based on the
battle of Lindisfarne, the first ever Viking raid in 793. The goal of the game is to defend your
monastery from the approaching Vikings who are trying to pillage your island and steal your gold.
You and your friend competes in real-time on who can hold off the Viking onslaught longest, in a
survival-style multiplayer duel. You and your friend will each play a fearsome monk who shoots
arrows to sink the approaching Viking ships. If you are attentive enough, you can try to catch the
moving power-ups and unlock short-term abilities for your monk. Once the Vikings ships reach the
shore, they begin their attack and deal damage to your monastery. Both you and your opponent’s
monastery’s health are indicated through a health bar. Each player will in addition to having its
own health bar shown at the screen, also have its opponent health bar showing. The player whose
health bar runs out first is looted by the Vikings. They steal your gold and you lose the game.
